    <h1>Year in Review, 2023-2024 (Benji Berners)</h1>
    <h3>Prompt.</h3>
    <p>What specific experiences (honors or otherwise) in the past year have had the most impact on your personal, academic, or professional goals and life trajectory? Which future experiences will further encourage this growth? Please articulate specific academic and/or professional goals for the next year.</p>
    <h3>Response.</h3>
    <p>This year, the experience related to summer music festivals was rather involved and impactful to me.  Summer fesivals are an essential part of a conservatory student's education; while I have access to excellent faculty at school all year, going out to study under many different teachers gives me different perspectives and ideas about how to play.  But the process doesn't start during the summer; it starts months before in the season for auditions.  The best festivals are quite competitive.  My goal is to become an orchestral cellist, so my focus this past winter was to work toward being able to attend high-level orchestral festivals.  I made a list of about 8 festivals to take auditions for.  I didn't choose the ones I was most likely to be accepted to; I chose the ones that I would learn the most from auditioning for.  Festival auditions are run in about the same way as professional orchestra auditions.  I had to learn about 20 orchestral excerpts, including Don Juan, the Haffner, Marriage of Figaro, Beethoven's Fifth, and numerous other standards.  Fortunately for me, this coincided with Orchestral Repertoire Masterclass, so I was able to get Professor Finkelshteyn's advice and coaching on many of the same excerpts I had to play for auditions.  Several of the auditions were recording submissoins, but three of them were in-person auditions, for which I drove to Bloomington, Chicago, and Cleveland.  The experience of an orchestral audition is something that takes a lot of getting used to.  There is so much buildup and anticipation, for an autition that may be under 5 minutes long.  It is generally said that you have to take about 30 or 40 auditions before you win one.  So, now I've done 3; that's a start.  I was waitlisted for some fairly competitive programs, including the National Repertory Orchestra and the National Orchestral Institute, so that gives me home that I will have some chance of being acceptied into such a program next summer.  Now that I have learned the excerpts, practicing them for future programs will be easier.  The programs I did get accepted to were solo and chamber music programs.  Although chamber music is not my main long-term focus, it is an excellent experience to be coached on chamber music and get to study under great chamber music faculty.  I attended the Ascent Cello Festival in Cincinnati, and got to have lessons and masterclasses with renowned cellists including Toke Moldrup, Astrid Schween, and Richard Aaron.  Following that, I attended the Baroque performance institute, which was probably the most intensive two weeks of my life.  There, I performed on Baroque cello and viola da gamba, and had an extremely intense class schedule studying Baroque performance practice.  This is quite a different experience from studying modern performance, especially because we play on gut strings and Baroque instruments; the technique of playing is much different when playing on gut strings.  Even for someone who intends to perform on modern strings for their carreer, the experience of playing on gut can teach you a lot about the instrument, especially because the strings are a lot less forgiving about weight and contact point.  It forces you to train technical skills that are sometimes overlooked when practicing on a modern metal-strung instrument.  Making connections with the faculty at the program is also an important reason to attend.  Rebecca Landell, one of the Baroque cello professors, teaches a Master's degree in Baroque cello at Oberlin; I am likely to apply to that when I finish my degree at Cincinnati.  Ken Slowik, another cello professor and the music director of the Baroque Performance Institute, organizes other early music summer festivals; I intend to apply to one of those next summer.</p>

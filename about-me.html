<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, my name is Benji Berners.  I am studying cello and mathematics.  I am interested in most pursuits of the academic sort, especially learning languages.  One of the languages I am fluent in besides English is German. I have been to Germany to go to the International Chamber Music Academy of Southern Germany; this was one of my favorite experiences because I got to meet people from all over the world and make music with them.  I love studying pure math for its own sake, particularly the abstract fields.  I like category theory, abstract algebra, and topology; one of my favorite mathematical concepts is isomorphisms.  Isomorphisms are a certain way of making an equivalence between mathematical objects, and I really like the way of thinking assoicated with it because it is basically intuitively clear, but it allows such complex theories to be built on it.
